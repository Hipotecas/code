# Code Editor Units


## Introduction

I will introduce `testCodeEditor` and `testCommand` in this article, which is used to test the code editor and command. It supplys a set of functions to create collections to use in the code editor.

### createCodeEditorServices

This function create an instance of a `TestInstantiationService` by defining and setting up various using the provided `ServiceCollection`
and adding them to a `DisposableStore`. The function takes two arguments - a `DisposableStore` to keep track of disposables, and an optional `ServiceCollection` that can be used to add or override services.

Within the function, the `define` and `defineInstance` functions are defined to register services and their implementations. These are then called
to define various services.

- IAccessibilityService
- IClipboardService
- IEditorWorkerService
- IOpenerService
- INotificationService
- IDialogService
- IUndoRedoService
- ILanguageService
- ILanguageConfigurationService
- ITextResourcePropertiesService
- IThemeService
- ILogService
- IModelService
- ICodeEditorService
- IContextKeyService
- ICommandService
- ITelemetryService
- ILanguageFeatureDebounceService
- ILanguageFeaturesService

Finally, the function creates an instance of `TestInstantiationService` using the defined services and adds a disposable function to the `DisposableStore` to dispose of any registered services when the store is disposed, then returns it.


```typescript
const define = <T>(id: ServiceIdentifier<T>, ctor: new (...args: any[]) => T) => {
  // the services is a map
  // this is check the service is already defined or not
  // if not, then set the ctor to the map
  // the push the id to the serviceIdentifiers
  if (!services.has(id)) {
    services.set(id, new SyncDescriptor(ctor));
  }
  serviceIdentifiers.push(id);
};
const defineInstance = <T>(id: ServiceIdentifier<T>, instance: T) => {
	if (!services.has(id)) {
		services.set(id, instance);
	}
	serviceIdentifiers.push(id);
};

```


### InstatiationService

#### invokeFunction
**invokeFunction** is to provide a way to call functions that require access to services prodived by the dependency injection container. It allows these services to be injected into the function without needing to explictly pass them as parameters.
